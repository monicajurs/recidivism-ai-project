# AI-Powered Recidivism Risk Assessment Dashboard

### Overview
This project demonstrates the design of a predictive analytics system that estimates the probability of criminal reoffending (recidivism). 
The model leverages machine learning algorithms and synthetic data to showcase responsible, transparent AI decision-support tools.

### Features
- Synthetic recidivism dataset with 10+ risk factors
- Automated preprocessing, SMOTE balancing, and hyperparameter tuning
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost model comparison, can choose which one is needed
- ROC-AUC performance evaluation and probability calibration
- Top 20 highest-risk visualization dashboard
- Responsible AI practices (no protected attributes, interpretable output)

### Technologies
Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas

### Visual Output
A ranked bar chart highlighting the top 20 predicted high-risk individuals, saved as CSV and shown within the notebook.

### Disclaimer
This project uses entirely synthetic data and is intended for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes only.
